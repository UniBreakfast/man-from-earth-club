  <h2>From 00:06:46 and up to 00:13:01</h2>

  <ol>
    <li o><b>ART</b>: John, we're all sorry to see you go. Truly.</li>
    <li o>Okay. Now we're done with that, what do we do for the rest of the afternoon? <b>HARRY</b>: Anyone got a good topic?</li>
    <li o><b>DAN</b>: Like this, maybe? Heh. <b>SANDY</b>: What is that? <b>DAN</b>: It's a burin off a parrot beak.</li>
    <li o>Inclined chisel point... Probably early Magdalenian. <b>ART</b>: May I see that? <b>DAN</b>: Sure.</li>
    <li o><b>ART</b>: Yes indeed, that's what it is. <b>LINDA</b>: What's a burin? <b>ART</b>: A burin is a flint tool</li>
    <li o>for grooving wood and bone, antlers especially, to make spear and harpoon points.</li>
    <hr>
    <li>Magdalenians weren't noted for flint work, so this is a very nice specimen. <b>HARRY</b>: Okay, what's a Magdalenian?</li>
    <li><b>DAN</b>: A later Cro-Magnon, without gettin' technical. It's the final culture of the upper Paleolithic.</li>
    <li>If stones could speak, eh, Art? So where'd you get that, John? <b>JOHN</b>: Believe it or not, from a thrift shop. A quarter.</li>
    <li><b>ART</b>: You lucky dog! I gotta go digging for this kind of stuff. <b>HARRY</b>: Can I, uh...?</li>
    <li><b>ART</b>: Yeah. <b>HARRY</b>: Huh.</li>
    <hr>
    <li o><b>JOHN</b>: Maybe... I'm glad you did this. <b>DAN</b>: Did what? You mean come over?</li>
    <li o>Maybe? <b>JOHN</b>: Definitely. <b>HARRY</b>: Gee, thanks. <b>DAN</b>: Well, so are we.</li>
    <li o>So are we. We couldn't let you just run off. <b>JOHN</b>: Thanks.</li>
    <li o><b>HARRY</b>: John, what is up, huh? Are you on America's most wanted? We won't turn you in.</li>
    <li o><b>DAN</b>: Yeah, come on, out with it. You're among friends. <b>EDITH</b>: Snoopy friends. <b>JOHN</b>: Forget it.</li>
    <li o><b>HARRY</b>: You are creating the mystery here. Obviously, you have something you'd like to say. Say it!</li>
    <li o><b>JOHN</b>: Well, maybe I... <b>HARRY</b>: Ten, nine, eight, seven... <b>SANDY</b>: Harry, stop.</li>
    <hr>
    <li><b>JOHN</b>: There is something I'm tempted to tell you, I think. I've never done this before, and I wonder how it'll pan out.</li>
    <li>I wonder if I could ask you a silly question. <b>ART</b>: John, we're teachers. We answer silly questions all the time.</li>
    <li><b>LINDA</b>: Hey! <b>JOHN</b>: What if a man from the upper Paleolithic survived until the present day?</li>
    <li><b>DAN</b>: What do you mean, survived? Never died? <b>JOHN</b>: Yes. What would he be like?</li>
    <li><b>HARRY</b>: Well, I know some guys. You ever been to the Ozarks?</li>
    <li><b>DAN</b>: It's an interesting idea. What, are you working on a science fiction story?</li>
    <li><b>JOHN</b>: Say I am. What would he be like? <b>HARRY</b>: Pretty tired.</li>
    <hr>
    <li o><b>DAN</b>: Well, seriously, As Art's book title suggests, he might be like any of us.</li>
    <li o><b>EDITH</b>: Dan. A caveman? <b>DAN</b>: Well, there's no anatomical difference between, say, a Cro-Magnon and us.</li>
    <li o><b>ART</b>: Except that as a rule, we've grown taller.</li>
    <li o><b>LINDA</b>: What's the selective advantage of height? <b>ART</b>: Better to see predators in tall grass, my dear.</li>
    <li o><b>DAN</b>: Actually, tall and skinny radiates heat more effectively in warmer climates.</li>
    <hr>
    <li><b>ART</b>: And as for neanderthals, I mean, we've all seen apish people. That strain's still with us. <b>EDITH</b>: But he'd be a caveman.</li>
    <li><b>DAN</b>: No, he wouldn't. John's hypothetical man would have lived through 140 centuries... <b>ART</b>: Yeah, roughly.</li>
    <li><b>DAN</b>: ...and changed with every one of them. I mean, assuming normal intelligence.</li>
    <li> Well, we think men of the upper Paleolithic were as intelligent as we are.</li>
    <li>They just didn't know as much. John's man would have learned as the race learned.</li>
    <li>In fact, if he had an inquiring mind, his knowledge might be astonishing.</li>
    <li>If you do write that, let me have a look at it. I'm sure you'll make some anthropological boners. <b>JOHN</b>: It's a deal.</li>
    <hr>
    <li o><b>LINDA</b>: What would keep him alive? <b>EDITH</b>: What does the biologist say? <b>HARRY</b>: Cigarettes.</li>
    <li o>And ice cream. All right, all right, I'll play. All right, um, in science fiction terms,</li>
    <li o>I would say... Perfect regeneration of the body's cells, especially in the vital organs.</li>
    <li o>Actually, the human body appears designed to live about 190 years. Most of us just die of slow poisoning.</li>
    <hr>
    <li><b>JOHN</b>: Maybe he did something right, something everybody else in history had done wrong.</li>
    <li> <b>ART</b>: What, like eat the food, drink the water, and breathe the air?</li>
    <li><b>DAN</b>: Prior to modern times, those were pristine. We've extended our lifespan in a world that's, uh...</li>
    <li>not fit to live in. <b>HARRY</b>: You know, it could happen. The pancreas turns over cells every 24 hours,</li>
    <li>the stomach lining in three days, the entire body in seven years, but the process falters.</li>
    <li>Waste accumulates, eventually proves fatal to function.</li>
    <li>Now if a quirk in his immune system led to perfect detox, perfect renewal, then yeah.</li>
    <li>He could duck decay. <b>EDITH</b>: Mm, that's a secret we'd all love to have.</li>
    <hr>
    <li o><b>JOHN</b>: Would you really want to do that?</li>
    <li o>Live 14,000 years? <b>ART</b>: Well, if I could stay healthy and I didn't age, I mean, why not?</li>
    <li o><b>LINDA</b>: Yeah. What a chance to learn. <b>SANDY</b>: Is anyone hungry?</li>
    <li o><b>HARRY</b>: You know, the more I think about it, yeah, it's possible.</li>
    <li o>Anything is possible, right? After all, one century's magic, another century's science.</li>
    <hr>
    <li>They thought Columbus was a nut job, right? Pasteur, Copernicus? <b>JOHN</b>: Aristarchus long before that. <b>HARRY</b>: Right.</li>
    <li><b>JOHN</b>: I had a chance to sail with Columbus, Only I'm not the adventurous type.</li>
    <li>I was pretty sure the Earth was round, but at that point, I still thought he might fall off an edge someplace...</li>
    <li><b>ART</b>: Look around, John. We just did. <b>DAN</b>: I suppose there's a joke in there somewhere,</li>
    <li>but I don't get it. <b>JOHN</b>: There's nothing to get. <b>DAN</b>: What are we talking about?</li>
    <hr>
    <li o><b>ART</b>: We were just talking about a caveman who survives until the present time.</li>
    <li o><b>JOHN</b>: As you said, what a chance to learn, once I learned to learn.</li>
    <li o><b>DAN</b>: Did you start the whiskey before we got here? <b>JOHN</b>: Pretend it's science fiction. Figure it out.</li>
    <li o><b>HARRY</b>: Okay, a-a. Very old Cro-Magnon living until the present. <b>JOHN</b>: Oh!</li>
