    <li o><b>DAN</b>: Well, you need help? &nbsp; <b>JOHN</b>: Sure.</li>
    <li o><b>HARRY</b>: Would you like to tell us what the hell that was all about? &nbsp; <b>JOHN</b>: I don't like good-byes.</li>
    <li o><b>HARRY</b>: Kind of the point of a good-bye party, John. Went to a certain amount of trouble, you know?</li>
    <li o>Could've at least stayed a few minutes, huh? Eaten some of the food we so feverishly prepared? &nbsp; <b>JOHN</b>: I apologize, Harry.</li>
    <hr>
    <li><b>EDITH</b>: But why are you moving so quickly? You only resigned a couple of days ago.</li>
    <li><b>DAN</b>: You got the history chair at Stanford? &nbsp; <b>JOHN</b>: I wish.</li>
    <li><b>HARRY</b>: Well, taquitos, chicken wings, Roastie-Toasties and beer.</li>
    <li>If we'd had more time, we'd have done something a little more grandiose.</li>
    <li>Candlelight dinner at McDonald's. Strippers. &nbsp; <b>JOHN</b>: Taquitos are fine.</li>
    <li><b>DAN</b>: A'right. Art's gonna be along, too. He's, uh, talking to a student. Pfft.</li>
    <li><b>EDITH</b>: Is George taking over for you? &nbsp; <b>JOHN</b>: George or Trimbell. Has the dean made up his mind? &nbsp; <b>SANDY</b>: He hasn't called.</li>
    <hr>
    <li o><b>EDITH</b>: My god! Wh-What is this? It looks like a Van Gogh, But I've never seen it before.</li>
    <li o><b>DAN</b>: Is that an original, John? &nbsp; <b>JOHN</b>: No, it's just a gift someone gave me. &nbsp; <b>EDITH</b>: Still, it's a superb copy.</li>

    <li o><b>EDITH</b>: Yeah, it's the same stretcher as Van Gogh used. &nbsp; <b>DAN</b>: Yeah, there's writing on the back in French.</li>
    <li o><b>EDITH</b>: Oh, "to my friend Jacques Borne." Wonder who that was? &nbsp; <b>JOHN</b>: Someone he knew, I guess.</li>
    <li o><b>HARRY</b>: Brilliant deduction, Sherlock. &nbsp; <b>EDITH</b>: Surely you'll have this looked at, appraised?</li>
    <li o><b>JOHN</b>: Well, maybe sometime, but I wouldn't really want money for it.</li>
    <hr>
    <li>That does it. Put that stuff in the kitchen. &nbsp; <b>HARRY</b>: No, I'm gonna put it in the bathroom, John.</li>
    <li><b>JOHN</b>: Gas is off, electricity's on. Get comfortable while you can. The furniture's going this afternoon.</li>
    <li><b>DAN</b>: It's been years since I sat on a floor. Heh. I can't remember her name.</li>
    <li><b>HARRY</b>: Eh, it's good for the back. &nbsp; <b>EDITH</b>: Can we do yoga exercises? <b>HARRY</b>: Tantric yoga, we can.</li>
    <hr>
    <li o><b>DAN</b>: So you're leaving good old "we teach you." Rather suddenly, you must admit.</li>
    <li o>Truth time, John. Is there a problem? &nbsp; <b>JOHN</b>: No.</li>
    <li o><b>DAN</b>: Oh, come on, you know we wanna help. &nbsp; <b>JOHN</b>: That's appreciated, but really - There's no problem.</li>
    <li o><b>DAN</b>: Well, now I am curious. Where are you going?</li>
    <li o><b>HARRY</b>: Givin' up tenure. &nbsp; <b>DAN</b>: A decade of professorship, in line to chair the department, and you don't know where you're going? &nbsp; <b>JOHN</b>: Call it cabin fever.</li>
    <hr>
    <li>After a while, I get itchy feet. I've done this before.</li>
    <li><b>DAN</b>: No, no, no, you're too young to have done this before. &nbsp; <b>EDITH</b>: And he hasn't aged a day in ten years.</li>
    <li>Every woman on the faculty would give anything to have that secret. &nbsp; <b>HARRY</b>: Is that what they're after, Edith? &nbsp; <b>HARRY</b>: Oh, stop, Harry.</li>
    <hr>
    <li o><b>SANDY</b>: Wow, can you pull this? &nbsp; <b>HARRY</b>: What the hell? &nbsp; <b>DAN</b>: What do you hunt? &nbsp; <b>JOHN</b>: Deer, mostly. Around big bear.</li>
    <li o><b>HARRY</b>: With a bow and arrow? &nbsp; <b>DAN</b>: Most people can't bag a deer with a rifle and a telescopic sight.</li>
    <li o>Though, good eatin'. &nbsp; <b>JOHN</b>: The best wild game. Lives naturally, eats naturally. &nbsp; <b>EDITH</b>: Well, it's beautiful.</li>
    <hr>
    <li><b>JOHN</b>: Art. Ah. &nbsp; <b>ART</b>: So, can I get an "a" for awesome? &nbsp; <b>LINDA</b>: Oh, my gosh.</li>
    <li>That was fun. &nbsp; <b>ART</b>: Hey, John. You know Linda. You had her last semester.</li>
    <li><b>JOHN</b>: Hi. &nbsp; <b>LINDA</b>: Hey. &nbsp; <b>ART</b>: She's one of my victims now. I'm taking her home. She wanted to come by and say hello good-bye.</li>
    <li><b>JOHN</b>: Is Art as tough as I hear? &nbsp; <b>LINDA</b>: Oh, archaeology's tough. Dr. Jenkins is a fine teacher. &nbsp; <b>ART</b>: Oh, that's very politic.</li>
    <li><b>LINDA</b>: It's very true. &nbsp; <b>ART</b>: Uh-huh. Something for you to read on the road, pal. &nbsp; <b>JOHN</b>: "Shadows of the cave: parallels to early man." Arhtur M. Jenkins.</li>
    <li><b>ART</b>: Publish or perish. &nbsp; <b>JOHN</b>: I'd rather read than write another one. Thank you.</li>
    <hr>

    <li o><b>DAN</b>: So there is a problem. &nbsp; <b>JOHN</b>: No. I just like to move on now and then.</li>
    <li o>It's a personal thing. &nbsp; <b>DAN</b>: Well, not to pry.</li>
    <hr>
    <li><b>JOHN</b>: I'm sorry I don't have more to offer you. Got conversation, some seats for your behinds, and, uh... </li>

    <li>Didn't even know they made it in green. What do they pay you? &nbsp; <b>JOHN</b>: Nothing is too good for my friends.</li>
    <li>But I'm sorry - we are down to plastic cups now. &nbsp; <b>DAN</b>: That's a sacrilege I'll tolerate.</li>
    <hr>
